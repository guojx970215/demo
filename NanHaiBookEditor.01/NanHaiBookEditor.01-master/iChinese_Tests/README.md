## Usage

For step-by-step instructions on using Yeoman and this generator to build a TODO AngularJS application from scratch see [this tutorial.](http://yeoman.io/codelab/)

Install `yo`, `grunt-cli`, `bower`, `generator-angular` and `generator-karma`:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo generator-karma generator-angular
```

If you are planning on using Sass, you will need to first install Ruby and Compass:
- Install Ruby by downloading from [here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) or use Homebrew
- Install the compass gem:
```
gem install compass
```

Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run `yo angular`, optionally passing an app name:
```
yo angular [app-name]
```

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview

## Installing npm and bower packages
```
npm isntall
bower install
```

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
